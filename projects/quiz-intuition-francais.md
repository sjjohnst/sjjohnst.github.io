<h1 class="title">Quiz d'intuition de genre français</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Overview</h2>
I have been known to misgender many French nouns, and try as I might, I can't seem to find that 
gender "feeling" that many French speakers talk about.

This project is a fun attempt to test wether that intuition even exists, because ultimately, 
I'm stubborn, and wasn't at first convinced that it did... <br>


You can check out the quiz questions [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GUtlurF9vzpAD3CyDYtkD4QNCOEr2gArqwF_gzvRYFU/edit),
which were intentionally designed to be difficult, in an attempt to control for native speakers
who essentially have most french nouns memorized anyways. <br>


You can see the results below.<br>

I admit defeat, the intuition is real, and I guess I just don't have it. 

Thank you everyone who participated in the quiz! The goal was 20 responses, and we got 32!
